# Command line application template for Node.js

Implement CLI application by editing [main.js](app/main.js).  
You may add new files to keep your code clean, if it is allowed in your challenge.

## How to get input parameters
You can get arguments as `args` in [main.js](app/main.js) where the `main` method is defined.

``` js
function main(argv) {
  // code to run
}
```

This `argv` is simply came from `process.argv` passed by `index.js`.

Use the standard `console.log` method to output results to `stdout`.

``` js
console.log(result);
```
